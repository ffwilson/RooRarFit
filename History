03-Oct-2016 Fergus Wilson V00-02-11
Compiles/links with Root 6 (tested on 6.06.08) although ROOT still 
has bug in RooStrParser.

24-Sep-2014 Fergus Wilson V00-02-10
Allow floating of meson radius in Rel Breit Wigner.

22-Sep-2014 Fergus Wilson V00-02-09
Modified numerator in RooRelBreitWigner to perform better

14-Sep-2014 Fergus Wilson V00-02-08
Convert to use release 24.5.12. Uses official Root 5.34.10 so BaBar's versiosn ofRooFitModel 
and RooFitCore no longer relevant.

12-Dec-2013 Fergus Wilson V00-02-07
Changed from RooComplex to std::complex to eliminate warning messages in ROOT v5.34.13

11-Sep-2013 Fergus Wilson V00-02-06
Had to add some headers so would compile under Fedora.

08-Aug-2013 Fergus Wilson V00-02-05
Implement bug fix in rarMLFitter::doProjPlot that Justin Albert found to prevent LLR projections crashing due to memory leaks.

07-Dec-2012 Fergus Wilson V00-02-04
Remembered rarVersion

07-Dec-2012 Fergus Wilson V00-02-03
Thanks to Albert Puig, you can now use weights with ascii data files.

04-Jul-2012 Fergus Wilson V00-02-02
Changed standalone GNUmakefile so it works again on macOSX with root >= 5.32.02

25-May-2012 Fergus Wilson V00-02-01
WebSrt doesn't allow 3 digit version numbers !

22-May-2012 Fergus Wilson V00-01-104
Corrected bug spotted by Simon Akar in RooRelBreitWigner that was introduced in V00-01-99.

05-Apr-2012  Fergus Wilson V00-01-103
Corrected Blatt-Weisskopf spin 0 factor in Relativistic Breit Wigner(0.0->1.0)

02-Apr-2012  Fergus Wilson V00-01-102
Added a Threshold function

15 Dec 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-101
RooFit in v5.32.00 of Root is incompaible with v5.30, which
is not backward compatible with 5.26, which is also different to the
BaBar 5.26 version. The RooDatasets no longer use ntuples/trees
internally so it is impossible to dump the contents as an ntuple
tree. To get round this, I have written two rarMLFitter methods
(createTreeFromDataset and saveAsRootFile) to extract the contents of
the RooDataset and create an ntuple that is version independent.

24 Nov 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-100
Prepare for public release

26 Aug 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-99
Added RooUniform method but it's only available in newer versions of ROOT or in standalone mode.
Updated RelBreitWigner so that it can cope with parameters define in units other than GeV.
Updated documentation.

04 Jul 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-98
Updated missing copyright notices.

21 Jun 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-97
Line 1428 in rarMLFitter.cc returns different results in different
root versions!
  RooArgList thisCompCoeffParams(*(thisCompCoeffList[j].getParameters(*_fullObs)));
Added a work around that may or may not cover all possibilities.

20 Jun 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-96
Added a class rarToyList to make it more obvious in the log file what
is being included in a toy simulation.

16 Jun 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-95 
Updated copyright message. Removed ancient macro definitions. Deleted
rarAction* classes as there will never be enough time to develop
them. Removed remaining #include<math>. Replaced hard-coded numbers
with const parameters.

16 Jun 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-94 
Cleaned up some of the code to add weights. It still doesn't work for
ascii files because RooFit no longer has an interface that allows the
weight to be set for ascii files.

16 Jun 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-93
Projection and SPlots now working in standalone root.

27 May 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-92
In standalone versions: "reduce" now works; can add weighted variable
but only if reading in data from a root file (because the read method
for ascii files has no option for adding a weight variable!);
eliminated "can't add to owned list" error for derived variables.

12 May 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-91
Updated GNUMakefile.new so that it will pick up root libraries in
v5.28 and v.5.29 when they have to be recompiled using a different
compiler than the default but unavailable CERN version.

07 Mar 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-90 
Back ported some of the changes need to compile in standalone mode
under ROOT >= v5.27, which has removed some of the methods available in
previous versions. Comment in the macro USENEWROOT from rarVersion.hh
to compile with ROOT version >= 5.27 (probably not the best macro name).

Although the code will compile and run in standalone mode, anything
that relies on the setWeightVar() method won't work (weight variable
has to be set when dataset created) and prints a warning. This affects
datasets if a weight variable is defined and SPlots (which relies on a
weight). This will need to be fixed later. "reduce" still does not
work on datasets in standalone mode with RooCategories ("AddOns").

Corrected the GNUmakefile.new for Mac OSX. Changed the "const"-ness of
some methods to avoid warnings printed by more picky compiler
versions.

09 Feb 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-89
Added some headers so RooRarFit will still compile under analysis-42

05 Feb 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-88
Updates to the documentation.

05 Feb 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-87
Implemented the Flatte distribution.

27 Jan 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-86
Really commit GNUmakefile.new,

27 Jan 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-85
Committed GNUmakefile.new, first version of a makefile for building on
mac/linux outside ABA environment.

24 Jan 2011 Fergus Wilson V00-01-84
Tweaking of tutorial configuration files and make_data.C

9 Dec 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-82
Made a first go at adding missing documentation for newer
functions. Converted the src/GNUmakefile to use makeinfo/tex
instaed of texi2html as makeinfo/tex should be available on more
systems. Documentation now points to CERN for the RooFit functions.

1 Dec 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-81

In this tag, the actions contained in rarMLFitter.cc (5300 lines) have
been split into individual files for each action. A base clase
rarAction.cc has been created which contains common methods and data
elements. Each action (pdffit, mlfit, scan, etc...) inherits from this
class and defines its own unique methods (which have just been copied
from rarMLFitter.cc). These classes are called "rarAct*.cc" where "*"
is the action name. A factory class (rarActionFactory.cc) selects the
right action based on the configuration files. An executable runAction
currently performs the functions of rarFit for the new code.

As far as the user is concerned everything remains the same and they
see no change in the output but it should make development easier as
changes can be made to individual actions or new actions added 
without affecting the others.

rarMLFitter.cc and rarFit are currently unchanged and the user can
continue to use them. The new code uses runAction in the same way as
rarFit so it is possible to compare the new code with the old. However
in the next tag rarMLFitter.cc should be retired and runAction renamed
to rarFit.

Some changes have been made to other code mainly to add "const" to
some parameters and methods to improve coding but there is still lots
to do.

2 Nov 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-80
combinePlot now stores the plots of the individual modes with the total and
statistical error NLL curves.

2 Nov 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-79
Remove combineCentralValue option from combinePlot.

2 Nov 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-78

I have added a new action combinePlot that will combine up to 10 NLL curves
from different fits and convolute with systematic errors. This
replaces the functionality of the combine.C and combine.C macros.

20 Oct 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-77
Update version number.

19 Oct 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-76
Eliminate some of the more obvious warnings when using a picky compiler.

13 Oct 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-75
I've added 4 files to doc/tutorial that can be used for regression
tests and/or a tutorial. make_data.C will create 3 datasets. The
datasets contain typical variables like mes, flavour tag and errors on
Delta t. The datasets can then be analysed using tutorial.config
(yields, branching fractions, charged CP asymmetries, projections,
splots and scans) and tutorial_v3.config (time-dependent CP
asymmetries). README_regression is will contain more information.

10 Sep 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-74
Added Voigtian and Gounaris-Sakurai pi-pi scattering functions.

08 Jul 2010 Fergus Wilson ffw-08Jul10
Updated RAL details in submitToy. Replaced mlFitNumCPU, pdfFitNumCPU
and toyFitNumCPU fields with a global useNumCPU that applies to all
calls. Added a stopwatch to rarFit.cc. Added (but not implemented) a
wrapper to the calls to fitTo() method.

18 Jun 2010 Fergus Wilson ffw-18Jun10
Completed replacement of stream headers with Riostream.h. 
Added a few more headers for standalone compiling.
Added a timer to the rarFit.cc main program.
Cleaned up rarVersion.h

15 Jun 2010 Fergus Wilson V00-01-73
Create an official tag for nightlies.

15 Jun 2010 Fergus Wilson ffw-15Jun10
Partially updated documentation. Added options pdfFitNumCPU and
toyFitNumCPU to change the number of CPUs/cores used during PDF and
Toy fitting. All fitTo() methods now pass parameters the official
way. Added rarLass and RooLass classes to allow fitting of LASS
experimental parametrisation.

14 Jun 2010 Fergus Wilson  ffw-14Jun10
Changes to enable compilation under SL5/RH5, Root 5.26 and
analysis-52. Added some header files to enable standalone compilation
outside the BaBar environment. Replaced <iostream> with "Riostream.h"
from ROOT. The root interface has changed slowly over time so this
code may not work in ealier versions Added the [MLAct] fit option
mlFitNumCPU to allow parallelising the mlfit over cores (default=1).

-rarVersion.hh : Comment in USEROOFIT230
-rarBasePdf.cc : added TAxis.h, TH1F.h. 
-rarMLFitter.cc : added TTree.h
-rarConfig.cc : added TTree.h
-rarNLL.cc : added TAxisI.h, TAxis.h, TMath.h
-rarMLFitter.cc : replaced old-style "FitOptions" parameter used in fitTo() method with new style for passing parameters.

25 Aug 2008 Joe Tuggle jmt-25Aug08
-rarMLFitter.cc: Fixed bug in doProjPlot concerning normalization over 
  conditional observables. Now in the calculation of the likelihoods, 
  conditional observables are _not_ included in the normalization.
-rarBasePdf.cc,rarMLFitter.rdl,rarMLFitter.cc: Added XErrorSize option to 
  actions that plot data. For example, if no x error bars are desired, usage is
    XErrorSize = 0.0
  Default is XErrorSize = 1.0
-rarMLFitter.cc: Added option to save the RooFitResult object in the mlFit 
  action. The object is saved in the results file. Usage:
   postMLWriteFitResult = yes
  Default is postMLWriteFitResult = no.
-rarMLFitter.cc: Added sPlots by category and asymmetry. Usage is analagous to
  categories and asymmetry in projPlots. Examples:
   sPlotCat = tagcat
   sPlotCat_mes = tagcat

   sPlotAsym = tagflavor
   sPlotAsym_deltat = tagflavor
  Note these caveats: sPlots use the quadrature sum of the sWeights as the 
  uncertainties. However, the asymmetry sPlot will round each bin to the 
  nearest integer and use errors given by binomial statistics (default for 
  RooHist::addAsymmetryBin).

25 Jan 2008 Lei Zhang V00-01-72

-rarBasePdf.cc: fix minor problem with physCat splitting

24 Mar 2007 Lei Zhang V00-01-60
-rarMLFitter.cc:
  1. Fix problem in function getLLRDataset wrt limits of derived variable in
     a dataset.
     if removing limits of derived columns is keeping causing problems,
     we should not remove the limits any longer,
     because if the limits are causing the problems,
     it usually should be fixed by changing the deriving formula,
     or other method. It is reasonable to have limits.

  2. minor bugs fixed for problem with splitCats in cases where
     physCat is the only splitCats

-rarDatasets.cc, rdl: tabulateDatasets for newly created dataset so that the
  dataset info displayed
-doc/Sample_configs/: for dt projection use the right dataset by cutting on

-doc: corresponding doc changes
-rarDatasets, rarMLFitter, etc.:
  Add blind constraint on all actions except pdfFit and toyStudy.
  It is now required in action section to specify dataset for each action
  explicitly. The default dataset specified by config fitData is used to
  build Pdf and do toy study only. Additional to this, it is required to
  acknowledge the fitter explicitly that a dataset is for unblinding in dsi
  section for any actions like mlFit, projPlot.
  Unblinding dataset does not necessarily unblind your results,
  as long as you use RooUnblindPrecision's and the state is set to blind,
  those variables they try to blind still remain blind.
  The unblind token is given by the fitter when you try to do one such
  action, follow the instruction given by the fitter. This token will change
  if the contents of the dataset change, so you need to reset the token once
  your dataset changes. You can concatenate those tokens together, separated
  by white space, so you do not need to change the token again if the
  dataset changes back.

29 Jul 2005 Lei Zhang
-rarMLFitter.cc: disable 0 event adjustment for toy study because people
  sometimes do want to generate 0 event for a component. If the total
  yields (expected number of events for extended model) is taken from
  prototype dataset, the largest yield (usually continuum background)
  will be adjusted. The preferable way to specify yields (as in online
  docs) is:
    [toyStudyAct]
    // toy options
    toyStudy = yes
    // init values for yields
    nSig = 160 L(0 - 300)
    nChmls = 1703 L(0 - 30000)
    nBkg = 5000 L(0 - 30000) // largest number will be adjusted
    // if it is pure toy, you do not need to specify how to generate
    // for embedded toy, for example you can do
    toySrc_nSig = sigMC "@0 nSig" // from sigMC
    toySrc_nChmls = bbMC 10 pdf "@0-10 nChmls" // 10 from bbMC, the rest from pdf

28 Jul 2005 Lei Zhang

-rarMLFitter.cc: fix bug in LLR/Projection plots
  The bug for LLR/Projection plots are pretty subtle. The origin of the bug
  is from how to construct likelihood ratio for mode with multi signal
  and/or multi background components. The description of the problem is
  excerpted from email exchange with Bill.

  ... Q2BFit (and RooRarFit for now) did not handle it right...
  The conclusion was from yesterday's (20th) discussion with Owen.
  The ratio, S/(S+B), has two separate variables, and for each of them,
  you could have multi components. The key question is how to get
  the right likelihood ratio for those two variables. Suppose you have
  2 signals S1 and S2, two backgrounds, B1 and B2. The way Q2BFit (and
  RooRarFit for now) does the calculation is to set the ratio to
  (S1+S2)/(S1+S2+B1+B2). The problem for this calculation is it does not
  take the relative normalization of individual background (or signal)
  components into account within S or B. We can transform the total Pdf
  model=s1*S1+s2*S2+b1*B1+b2*B2 to
  model=s*((1-s_frac)S1+s_frac*S2)+b*((1-b_frac)B1+b_frac*B2) and the
  likelihood ratio should be S/(S+B)=((1-s_frac)S1+s_frac*S2)/
  ((1-sfrac)S1+s_frac*S2+(1-b_frac)B1+b_frac*B2). We find this problem
  because in KsKsKl analysis we include a component which
  is very signal like and we fix the yield of that component to
  a small known number. If you do the wrong calculation,
  S/(S+B)=S/(S+S'+B) where S' is close to S, so even if B=0,
  the ratio can hardly pass .5 much...

-rarMLFitter: enhanced toy study facilities. Enhancements include:
  * Enhanced prototype observable generating. If prototype dataset is needed,
    you can choose to generate prototype observables from any of the
    sources:
    1) RooFit default prototype dataset
    2) Prototype datasets for each component
    3) Prototype observable generator built by RooRarFit
  * Enhanced parameter scanning. It is quite common to do a set of toy
    experiments over several parameter points, for example, for different
    signal yields, fLs, C and S, etc. The new toy engine can do that for you
    automatically, and you will get toys done over a whole range of
    interested points just in one toy job.
  * Enhanced embedded study. With the new toy engine, it is possible to
    randomize observables so that you end up embedding from different MC
    samples effectively. For example, you can embed events with C and S
    specified as different from those in the original MC sample, the
    embedding engine will figure out what tagFlav should be for those C and
    S.

28 May 2005 Lei Zhang V00-00-03
-configs plotRange added so plot can have different ranges than the defaults
-rarBasePdf rarConfig, rarDatasetDef, rarDatasets: bugs with
  createFundamental fixed. I did not quite understand why we created
  `fundamental' vars for derived obs in datasets. Now I think the reason is
  to have those fundamental vars as observables for pdf so as to drop the
  dependency of those derived obs to the original obs. So for each derived
  obs in rarDatasetDef and rarDatasets, there will be a `fundamental' one
  based on it. And the dependents of pdf should be those fundamental ones.
-rarBasePdf: bugs for _thisSimPdf RooSimultaneous fixed. This pdf is useful
  for projection plot, and maybe later for sPlots.

17 Apr 2005 Lei Zhang lz-2005Apr17
-I made this tag because I am going to make the head of yaQ2BFit runnable in
  analysis-23. The motivation for this is from that it looks to me the new
  RooFit for ROOT4 is not quite stable and some bugs are still there, which
  might be a little bit subtle. I find this because when I was trying to get
  splitting work with omegaKs mode, I could not get the right yields with
  splitting, while Jim could with almost the same configs. I finally figured
  out it was due to the RooFit versions I was using were not quite recent.

  The old RooFit has been used and tested for a long time and I'd better
  trust the results from that version if some problem rises. Since some of
  the functions were missing when we made a tag working for old RooFit and
  the fitter is still changing fast. It is reasonable to make the head
  runnable with the old RooFit.

15 Apr 2005 Lei Zhang
-RooSimPdfBuilder object is now created persisting

14 Apr 2005 Lei Zhang
-yaQ2BDatasets, yaQ2BConfig, yaQ2BDatasetDef:

   data file.
-other minor fixes

-yaQ2BAddPdf.cc, yaQ2BBasePdf.cc, yaQ2BDatasets.cc, yaQ2BMLFitter.cc:
  fix potential problems with RooArgSet::readFromFile
-yaQ2BDatasets.cc: Category tabulation more robust
-yaQ2BConfig.cc: Check name not to be notSet

06 Apr 2005  Lei Zhang lz-2005Apr06
 - tag for the new schema of yaQ2BFit

05 Apr 2005 Lei Zhang
 - Made suggested config schema changes
   As I am trying to get TD analysis work, I realize it might be helpful to
   change the schema a little bit.
   For example, the old way:
	configStr=Gaussian de "Optional Title"
	mean=...
	sigma=...
   current way:
	configStr=Gaussian "Optional Title"
	x=de
	mean=...
	sigma=...
   x is the observable, and it is set to de for this case.
   If the pdf has more observables, the second one is usually y,
   the third one z, and so on, unless there is strong reason not to do so.
   For example, dtErr in the GaussianModel will be called
   msSF/meanSF/sigmaSF instead of y.
   
   The reason for this change is that in RooFit,
   observables and parameters are not absolute.
   In one scenario one variable is observable, in another,
   it might be parameters. By taking the default observables out of
   the configStr, it makes the configs more RooFit compatible and
   gives the fitter more freedom.

(excerpts from email about the docs of yaQ2BFit)
I added the initial version of yaQ2BFit documentation.
To build your own docs, please type in the release dir
                                                                                                                                               
gmake Q2BFit.guide
                                                                                                                                               
You will then build all the documentation. All the docs built can be found
in Q2BFit/doc of your working release, including:
  * yaQ2BFit.html  -the main page
  * yaQ2BFit.pdf   -pdf version
  * html/          -doxygen generated source code ref pages
  * refman.pdf     -pdf version
However, you may need updated tools to get all the docs built, namely,
texinfo tools and doxygen tools. (unfortunately, machine @ slac may have
some versions way too old)
                                                                                                                                               
You can always find updated docs from my webpage, the url is
                                                                                                                                               
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~zhanglei/yaQ2BFit/yaQ2BFit.html
                                                                                                                                               
The structure of the docs:
* The main doc page is generated from texinfo source files and it has two
  versions: html (the url) and pdf (link in the webpage).
* source code documentation is generated from source codes by doxygen. I
  could use Root's own documentation engine, but I think doxygen can
  produce more elegant and useful docs. Anyway, the source codes are
  RootHtml compatible.
  This part of the docs has html and pdf versions, too, and is accessible
  through the main webpage.

02 Feb 2005 Lei Zhang
-yaQ2BFit, the new mlFitter for rare B study, added.
  all the source files for this fitter have prefix yaQ2B. (yet another
  (Q2B)Fitter). Now the implemented functions of the fitter include pdf
  fitting, pdf plotting, ml fitting, (pure, embedded) toy study.
  More will be added so that it can at least do what the old fitter does.
  It serves as a wrapper of RooFit and Root so that most of ml fitting
  action (and plotting, etc) are driven by readable (ascii) config file.

  The classes/source codes of the mlFitter can be classified into three
  groups:
  1) auxiliary classes/codes
     yaQ2BFit.cc: the main program
       It first instantiates dataset definition class to define dataset,
       then it reads in all the datasets through dataset class,
       then it instantiates mlFitter class so that all the pdf are
       created, and finally it calls run() of the fitter to finish the job.
       If successfully compiled and linked, type yaQ2BFit in workdir
       to see short help page.
     yaQ2BStringParser: breaks a string into tokens separated by spaces.
       characters inside quote(") are considered one token
  2) dataset classes
     yaQ2BDatasetDef: defines the format of dataset
     yaQ2BDatasets: holds all the datasets read in from ascii or root
       files, and datasets derived from those primary datasets.
  3) pdf classes
     yaQ2BBasePdf: the base class of pdf builder
       It has several variables common to all the pdf builders,
       and after created, it calls init() for initialization.
     yaQ2BCompBase: the base class for composite pdf builder (add and
       product for now)
     yaQ2BProdPdf: product pdf builder
     yaQ2BAddPdf: add pdf builder
     yaQ2BMLFitter: mlfitter class, sub-class of yaQ2BAddPdf
       the main program, yaQ2BFit.cc, builds pdfs from top to bottom by
       instantiating a object of yaQ2BMLFitter.
       the fitter's actions (fitting, plotting, etc) are done through
       calling its run() function by the main program. In the run()
       function, the fitter will read in additional options for each
       pdf before any other actions.
     yaQ2BBGGaussPdf (Bifur-Gaussian), yaQ2BGaussianPdf (Gaussian),
     yaQ2BPolynomialPdf (Polynomial), yaQ2BTwoGaussPdf (Double-Gaussian):
       individual pdf builders. Will add more.

  The structure of config file:
  The sections in config file are in three groups:
  1) Dataset: has two sections
      [Dataset Config]
    This section defines the format of all the datasets
    and is read by yaQ2BDatasetDef.
    For the purpose of reusability of the format section and
    conciseness of config file, it is recommended the contents of
    this section put in a separate file and included in this section
    by include directive of RooFit
      [Dataset Input]
    This section defines all the datasets and is read by yaQ2BDatasets.
    The section name can be changed by -D option at command line.
  2) Pdf Config: has several pdf config sections
      [mlFitter Config]
    This section defines the fitter function (ml function).
    The section name can be changed by -C option at command line.
    Pdfs as ingredients for ml function are configured by their own
    sections. The section names of such pdfs consist of pdf name, pdf
    type, etc, for example:
      [ContinuumPdf Config]
    could be the section for continuum pdf
      [de Polynomial ContinuumPdf Config]
    could be the section for de continuum pdf.
  3) mlFitter Action Config: controls the fitter's behavior
      [Action Config]
    This section drives the fitter to finish its job.
    The section name can be changed by -A option at command line.
    The actions now available are: pdfFit, postPdfMakePlot (as part of
    pdfFit), mlFit, and toyStudy. The default for all those actions are
    no action. So it is possible to have several sections with one action
    per section, and then run the fitter with -A option to specify which
    action to finish.

  The new fitter is reasonably independent of RooFit/Root so that there is
  no need to revise the codes when RooFit/Root upgrades if the external
  RooFit/Root public function interfaces remain unchanged.
